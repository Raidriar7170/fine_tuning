## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Keep public search targets aligned to canonical query slots
The public sample dataset SHALL encode public-readonly search/weather task targets with compact `slots.query` strings that align with the canonical `normalized_command` query phrase.

#### Scenario: Build public sample search rows
- **WHEN** the public sample dataset is generated or inspected
- **THEN** the search/weather seed row and its schema-preserving augmentations MUST use `slots={"query":"北京明天天气"}`
- **AND** the same rows MUST use `normalized_command="搜索北京明天天气"`
- **AND** they MUST NOT use `slots.city`, `slots.date`, or artificial token-spaced query strings such as `北京 明天 天气`

#### Scenario: Build public sample DPO pairs
- **WHEN** DPO pairs are generated or inspected for the public search/weather seed row
- **THEN** chosen contracts MUST preserve the compact `slots.query` target
- **AND** wrong-slot hard negatives MAY alter the query value but MUST NOT introduce `city/date` as an accepted target shape
