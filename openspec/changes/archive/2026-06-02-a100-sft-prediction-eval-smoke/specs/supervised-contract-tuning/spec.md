## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Export A100 trained-path public-sample predictions
The system SHALL provide a bounded prediction export workflow for the A100 public-sample SFT adapter path that emits only sanitized public-sample prediction rows for contract evaluation.

#### Scenario: Launch trained-path prediction with explicit opt-in
- **WHEN** a developer launches trained-path public-sample prediction with an explicit prediction opt-in and a configured private adapter path
- **THEN** the system loads the configured adapter path, generates prediction rows for the committed public sample, and writes a sanitized prediction JSONL artifact without copying checkpoints, adapters, raw logs, caches, or private remote paths into git

#### Scenario: Reject accidental private prediction
- **WHEN** a developer launches prediction without the explicit prediction opt-in or without a configured adapter path
- **THEN** the system does not load private model artifacts and instead emits a dry-run or fixture-mode result that clearly states no private adapter prediction occurred

#### Scenario: Record prediction provenance safely
- **WHEN** trained-path prediction output is prepared for public evidence
- **THEN** the system records the base model ID, model source label, dataset manifest ID, adapter release status, prediction source kind, and command summary using public-safe placeholders rather than private filesystem paths or host details
