## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Use consistent contract-only SFT chat formatting
The system SHALL serialize real SFT training examples and trained-adapter prediction prompts with a consistent contract-only chat format that uses tokenizer chat templates when available and a deterministic fallback when unavailable.

#### Scenario: Serialize real SFT training examples
- **WHEN** the real SFT training path builds text examples from public-sample or private SFT rows
- **THEN** each example contains the contract-only system instruction, the user command or ASR transcript, and the canonical Browser Task Contract JSON assistant target using the same chat serialization policy used by prediction

#### Scenario: Serialize trained-adapter prediction prompts
- **WHEN** trained-adapter prediction builds a prompt for a public-sample row
- **THEN** the prompt contains the contract-only system instruction, the user command or ASR transcript, and a generation prompt for a Browser Task Contract JSON object without explanatory prose, Markdown, or GUI actions

#### Scenario: Fall back without heavy dependencies
- **WHEN** a tokenizer does not expose a chat template or local validation does not load a tokenizer
- **THEN** the system uses a deterministic plain-text fallback that preserves the same roles, contract-only instruction, and assistant generation boundary

### Requirement: Keep recovery predictions honest
The system SHALL keep trained-adapter output recovery focused on model prompt/training format and shall not replace invalid private-adapter outputs with rule-baseline, fixture-mode, or gold-contract predictions.

#### Scenario: Preserve invalid model output
- **WHEN** a private adapter emits invalid JSON or a non-contract JSON object
- **THEN** the prediction artifact preserves the sanitized model output as a schema failure candidate rather than substituting a valid fixture or rule-normalized contract

#### Scenario: Record recovery run provenance
- **WHEN** a recovery SFT or prediction run is prepared for public evidence
- **THEN** the metadata records the formatting policy, base model public ID, dataset manifest ID, prediction source kind, adapter release status, and command summary using public-safe placeholders
